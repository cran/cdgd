Description: Estimates the causal decompositions of group disparities developed by Yu and Elwert (2025) <doi:10.1214/24-AOAS1990>. For the nuisance functions of the estimators, we provide both parametric and nonparametric options, as well as manual options in case the default models are not satisfying.
